# Encapsulation 

- objects consist of `behavior` and `state`
- the process of binding behavior and state into a single unit is called `encapsulation` 
- in well encapsulated Objects, internal state of an object is not visible to the external world.  
- providing getters/setters only if they are necessary 
- start with the most restrictive access modifiers for fields! 
- add access methods as required
